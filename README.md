Hello, I'm Hexagoñ, you may also find me as "The_ñ", "Hexagon_6", "The_Enye" and similar usernames in other platforms, although I don't use social media very much. 

I have interest in programming and curiosity for almost any topic surrounding computer science. I'm currently still learning full-stack web development, and I'm also looking to incorporate game development.
